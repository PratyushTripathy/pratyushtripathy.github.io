Hi, I'm **Pratyush Tripathy**, a PhD student in the Department of Geography at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My research focuses on remote sensing, machine learning, Python, and automated workflows to address complex geospatial challenges.

I am passionate about developing open‚Äêsource tools for environmental monitoring and urban analysis. My projects include contributions to applications such as *Global Flood Mapper*, the Python package *pyrsgis*, and the tool *COINS* for street network analysis.

You can learn more about my work on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cpHC_JgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [GitHub](https://github.com/PratyushTripathy), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pratyush-tripathy-b28a47146/) profiles.
