Hi, I'm **Pratyush Tripathy**, a PhD student in the Department of Geography at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I bridge **remote sensing**, **machine learning**, and **econometric methods**â€”all with an eye toward contributing to environmental challenges, natural hazard management, and impact evaluation through causal analysis.

I have  abackground training in Geoinformatics and therefore I fond myself working on a wide variety
of projects that use remote sensing and GIS, and machine learning. The kind of projects that I have worked
and/or still interested in working includes:
- Flood mapping and impact assessment
- Downscaling population and socio-economic indicators
- Predicting deforestation in the Amazon 
- Urban spatial analysis
  - Building height mapping
  - Urban growth models
  - Street network analysis
