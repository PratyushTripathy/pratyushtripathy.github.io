# Hello, I’m Pratyush Tripathy!

I am a **PhD student** in the Department of Geography at the **University of California, Santa Barbara**, where I bridge **remote sensing**, **machine learning**, and **econometric methods**—all with an eye toward contributing to environmental challenges, natural hazard management, and impact evaluation through causal analysis.

I have  abackground training in Geoinformatics and therefore I fond myself working on a wide variety
of projects that use remote sensing and GIS, and machine learning. The kind of projects that I have worked
and/or still interested in working includes:
- Flood mapping and impact assessment
- Downscaling population and socio-economic indicators
- Predicting deforestation in the Amazon 
- Urban spatial analysis
  - Building height mapping
  - Urban growth models
  - Street network analysis

Check out my [Projects](/projects/) and [Publications](/publications/) to learn more.

## Open-Source Contributions
I’m passionate about democratizing geospatial data science. Some of my projects include:
- [**Global Flood Mapper**](https://github.com/PratyushTripathy/global_flood_mapper) – A Google Earth Engine app for rapid flood detection  
- [**pyrsgis**](https://github.com/PratyushTripathy/pyrsgis) – A Python package for reading, processing, and exporting GeoTIFFs  
- [**COINS**](https://github.com/PratyushTripathy/COINS) – An automated tool for generating street network hierarchies from OSM data


See my [CV](/cv/) for a full list of awards and experience.
